= ng-iban - validate input fields as IBAN
The goal is to provide an easy way to validate an input field as an IBAN number with https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS].
From version `0.4.0` the module uses https://github.com/arhs/iban.js[iban.js] for validation.

== Usage
First add

* `AngularJS`
* `ng-iban`

to your HTML file.

Make sure you require `mm.iban` as a dependency of your AngularJS module.

== Installation
`bower install ng-iban`

=== directive
[source,html]
----
<input type="text" ng-model="iban" ng-iban/>
----

To use this directive the `ngModel` directive must also be used because this directive depends on it.
