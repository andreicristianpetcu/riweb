Ripple\n\n## Command line git repository & branch manager\n\nRipple was inspired by and does it's best to adhere to the principals described in Vincent Driessen's excellent blog post; [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).\n\nBy automating and enforcing a strict yet very logical branching model, ripple both makes working with your git repository easier as well as more robust and well documented at the same time.\n\n## Installation\n\n\tnpm install -g ripple\n\n## What it can do for you\n\nRipple will make your branch model simple, consistent, repeatable, and descriptive. If you are an individual developer, it will help you stay organized. If you work as part of a team, it will work wonders on keeping your team on the same page, and keeping you from tripping over each other.\n\n* Create a new git repository from scratch, with appropriate tree structure.\n* Create a new package.json and start managing an existing get repo / project.\n* Create \"feature\" branches, from other feature branches or from \"develop\".\n* Create \"release\" and \"hotfix\" branches with automated versioning.\n* Integrate release and hotfix branches for release, by properly merging them back into your master and development branches.\n* Smartly integrate hotfix branches into an existing release branch rather than develop, if one exists, and\n\t* Automatically advance version on release branch if a hotfix was required during a release cycle.\n* Automatically tag releases with the correct integration version number.\n* Keep you adhered to the principals outlined in \"A successful git branching model\".\n\t* No more than one active hotfix\n\t* Make sure you apply hotfixes and releases in the correct order\n\n## Examples\n\nAll examples below show the branch that is currently checked out within the prompt.\n\n### Create a new project from scratch\n\n\tiMac:test cscade $ ripple init test\n\tInitializing new ripple project\n\t  creating new git repository where there was none\n\t  creating new package.json on \"master\" for project test version 0.0.1\n\t  commiting package.json\n\t  creating new \"develop\" branch\n\tok.\n\n### Work on a feature\n\n\tiMac:Ripple cscade [develop] $ ripple start feature docs\n\tStarting feature branch\n\t  creating new docs branch from \"develop\"\n\tok.\n\t\n... do stuff, commit things ...\n\t\n\tiMac:Ripple cscade [docs] $ ripple finish feature \n\tFinishing feature branch\n\t  merging docs into develop\n\t  removing docs branch\n\tok.\n\n### Create a release\n\t\n\tiMac:Ripple cscade [develop] $ ripple start release\n\tStarting release branch\n\t  creating new release branch from \"develop\"\n\t  updating version: 0.0.12 -> 0.0.13\n\t  commiting changes\n\t[release-0.0.13 357f066] bump version to 0.0.13\n\t 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)\n\tok.\n\t\n... polish, update your docs, etc ...\n\t\n\tiMac:Ripple cscade [release-0.0.13] $ ripple finish release\n\tFinishing release branch\n\t  merging release-0.0.13 into master\n\t  tagging version 0.0.13 on master\n\t  merging release-0.0.13 into develop\n\t  removing release-0.0.13 branch\n\tok.\n\n## Help\n\n\tiMac:Ripple cscade $ ripple wtf\n\n\t  Usage: ripple [options] [command]\n\n\t  Commands:\n\n\t    status \n\t      Output current status of the active project.\n\n\t    start <type> [name]\n\t      Create a new branch of type \"feature\", \"release\", or \"hotfix\".\n\t      If it's a feature branch, provide a name.\n\n\t    bump <part>\n\t      Bump version number while on a release branch.\n\t      Specify \"major\", \"minor\", or \"revision\".\n\n\t    finish <type>\n\t      Finish and merge the current release or hotfix branch.\n\t      Specify \"feature\", \"release\", or \"hotfix\".\n\t      Always commits!\n\n\t    init <name> [version]\n\t      Initialize a ripple project here (creating a repository if needed), with the given project name and version number.

Projects can be in any language, and contain anything git can handle. Ripple is available as a global executable in your terminal just like git, and uses git-like command options.\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Carson Christian &lt;cc@amplego.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","_id":"ripple@0.1.1","dist":{"shasum":"d6dd53c13e709cf8ec40d8fa7f7079e0b9622cea","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ripple/-/ripple-0.1.1.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.49","_npmUser":{"name":"cscade","email":"cc@amplego.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cscade","email":"cc@amplego.com"}],"directories":{}}},"readme":"# Ripple\n\nCommand line git repository & branch manager, with release tools.
